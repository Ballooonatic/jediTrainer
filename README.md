# Jedi Trainer

Play the original at [LostVectors.com](http://www.lostvectors.com/jeditrainer/index.html)

a Javascript remake of the classic lostvectors.com flash game

## How to try it out

1. Make sure you have Node installed!
2. Simply clone this project to your machine
3. cd into your chosen folder
4. install express: `npm i`
5. run the server file with node: `node server.js`
6. visit localhost:8000 in your browser

For now, all the PIXI stuff is handled by CDN.

## Gameplay

_Note: many of these features are still WIP._

Move your saber around with the mouse to hit the drones and deflect their lasers back at them.

Un-deflected lasers that hit your handle will hurt you.

Hold left-click to keep the rotation of your saber in place.

Moving out of bounds will drain your health.
